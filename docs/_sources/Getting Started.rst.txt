Installation
==================================

These macros can be installed two ways: 

* On the server for CPS
* or locally on a Windows computer. 

It's most reliable if it's set up server side.

Server-Side Installation
-----------------------------------

* Install on a jboss server or something like that.
  
  We use CPS via Citrix given that we have different sites. Using the macros on the server side has better reliability. For some macros, for example, an icon is matched on the screen. 
* Create a quicktext to launch (if you'd like to keep it hidden from CPS users until you've tested it out.)
* Create a Custom Command on the Toolbar for users to launch
